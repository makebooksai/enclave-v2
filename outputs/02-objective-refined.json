    "analysis": "The listed requirements are generally understandable but are not fully complete; they mix must‑have and nice‑to‑have items without explicit acceptance definitions, and several critical functional, non‑functional, and quality constraints are missing. The single success criterion is measurable but too coarse, lacking verification of each core feature, security checks, performance, and usability. Recommendations focus on clarifying acceptance criteria, adding missing constraints, and expanding measurable success metrics.",
